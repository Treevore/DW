**"Take `+1` forward"** take bonus/debuff on next move roll (not damage)

- Take `-2` forward on next discern reality
- Take `+3` forward on any forceful moves
- Take `+1` forward on all moves

**"Take `+1` ongoing"** take bonus/debuff on all move rolls (must have a way to end)

- Take `-1` ongoing for hack n slash (until you dismiss the spell)

# Death

## Last Breath

When you’re dying you catch a glimpse of what lies beyond the Black Gates of Death’s Kingdom (the GM will describe it). Then roll (just roll, no bonuses). 

- `10+` you’ve cheated death— you’re in a bad spot but you’re still alive.
- `7–9` Death will offer you a bargain. Take it and stabilize or refuse and pass beyond the Black Gates into whatever fate awaits you.
- `miss` your fate is sealed. You’re marked as Death’s own and you’ll cross the threshold soon. The GM will tell you when.

## **Resurrection (Cleric, 3rd level)**

Tell the GM you would like to resurrect a corpse whose soul has not yet fully departed this world. Resurrection is always possible, but the GM will give you one or more (possibly all) of these conditions to fulfill:

- It’s going to take `days / weeks / months`
- You must get help from `character / deity / location`
- • It will require a lot of `money / ingredients`
- • You must sacrifice `enemy / npc / self` to do it

The GM may, depending on the circumstances, allow you to resurrect the corpse now, with the understanding that the conditions must be met before it’s permanent, or require you to meet the conditions before the corpse is resurrected.

## Things to consider

Resurrection conditions can be worked on as a group

Play new character at level 1, if old character is resurrected play interchangeably where it makes sense
